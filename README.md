Here is another simple, however interesting front-end web game! 

• Press any key to start the game. It will trigger the game mechanism that beeps one of the four colored boxes on the screen. 

• The beeped box goes into an array which stores the sequence of color buttons to be pressed. 

• You have to reproduce this exact sequence. Once the full sequence has been reproduced, another colored button gets added, leveling your score up. 


• How can I play?
